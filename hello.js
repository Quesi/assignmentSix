And my essentials were in need of a redress. Lord knows my soul needed a combustion; no fear of being charred. The people; they starred with beseeching eyes and smoldering intensity. Some lavished with praise till the sugar eased off their tongues. They failed to see, though your exterior was intricate, you were just an icon of simplicity. And still others undermined your value in mimic theory songs</h2>')

I would save for things like a â€˜disco watchâ€™, a fan fair or party coming up and other silly things. My mother was proud and not proud of me at the same time. She was proud because I was saving to buy and do my own stuff, easing the pressure on her, and she wasnâ€™t proud because I was saving for a short time. I think the longest I saved was for 3 weeks, and I canâ€™t count the number of times she encouraged me to save for longer periods.</h2>')
